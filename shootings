                <p>The data for this visualisation was downloaded from the FiveThirtyEight Github Data Repository. The Guardian created this dataset for their project The Counted. The Counted is a working database that attempts to monitor the amount of people annually killed by police in the United States. The database examines the demographics of those killed by police and law enforcement agencies. The <a href="policekillings.csv">dataset</a> was clean and did not have to be cleaned.</p></article>

            <p>This dataset is a basic visual that displays total police killings by race. At first glance, the above models can be easily mis-interpreted.</p>
            <p>The amount of Black people that die from police killings is disproportionate to the total population of Black people in the United States. Although black people only represent 12.7% of the total U.S. population, 29.5% of the total number of recorded deaths from police killings in the United States in 2015 were Black people.</p>
            <p>Non-hispanic, white people, on the other hand, represented 60.4% of the total U.S. population and comprised 50.6% of total police killings in 2015.</p> 
            <p>A pivot table examining the intersection between race and ethnicity and the individuals who were killed by police was generated to produce the above data visualisations. These two graphs were chiefly added to demonstrate how at least one more dataset, containing total U.S. demographic information, is necessary to create an accurate understanding of police killings by race in 2015.</p>

This particular dataset is important to study because, unlike the spread of different races and ethnicities in the U.S., the gender distribution –– or the amount of men and women in each population –– are approximately equal at ~50% (+/-10%). Therefore, this dataset  accurately affirms that far less women were killed by police and law enforcement agencies than men in 2015.</p>
            <p>This phenomenon deserves to be further studied and viewed as a potential way to initiate positive societal changes and reduce police killings of United States citizens. If this trend exists beyond 2015 and far less women are getting killed by police each year, women's actions and interactions with the U.S. law enforcement system should be studied and potentially passed on to men.</p>
